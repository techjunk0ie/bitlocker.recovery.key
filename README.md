BitLocker is a Microsoft encryption product that is designed to protect the user data on a computer. If a problem with BitLocker occurs, you will encounter a prompt for a BitLocker recovery key. If you do not have a working recovery key for the BitLocker prompt, you are unable to access the computer.

## How Was BitLocker Activated On My Device?

**_There are three common ways for BitLocker to start protecting your device:_**

* Your device is a modern device that meets certain requirements to automatically enable device encryption: In this case, your BitLocker recovery key is automatically saved to your Microsoft account before protection is activated.
* An owner or administrator of your device activated BitLocker protection (also called device encryption on some devices) through the Settings app or Control Panel: In this case the user activating BitLocker either selected where to save the key or (in the case of device encryption) it was automatically saved to their Microsoft account.
* A work or school organization that is managing your device (currently or in the past) activated BitLocker protection on your device: In this case, the organization may have your BitLocker recovery key.
